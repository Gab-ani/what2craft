# what2craft
A little utility software piece to work with albion online data
___________________________

The service will communicate with [albion data project](https://github.com/broderickhyman/albiondata-client) database and find possible efficient crafts.
The goal of development is mostly sportsmanship and professional growth, but the project could have overhelming potential depending on game state.
